Soapbox Robotics Web Compiler
=======

Soapbox Robotics Web Compiler is based on Blocklyduino and Codebender compiler

### Welcome to Soapbox Robotics Web Compiler

BlocklyDuino is a **web-based visual programming editor for [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/)**.

BlocklyDuino is based on [Blockly](http://code.google.com/p/blockly/), the web-based, graphical programming editor

[Codebender](https://codebender.cc) compiler is a fast cloud-based compiler 

### Features

* Programming Arduino by drag-and-drop blocks
* Generate fully compatible Arduino source code
* Compile Arduino code with error checking
* Upload Arduino code to Arduino-capable devices
* Graphically monitor serial input

### Instructions
To compile and upload to Arduino devices, download codebender plugin @ https://codebender.cc/static/plugin 

Plugin works only on Firefox and Chrome browser on:
* Windows (from Windows XP up to the Windows 10 Beta) 
* Mac OS X 10.6-10.10
* Linux

For mobile devices running iOS, Android & ChromeOS:

* Blocklyduino (Graphical Programming) and code error checking still function
* Users can still copy the generated Arduino and paste it on Arduino-capable devices.

To hack the compiler:
* Git clone
* Host files in web server and insert localhost/apps/blocklyduino/index.html in the address bar
* Have fun hacking!
* Share your findings with us to improve
